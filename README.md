# Classification Machine Learning


## 1. Haberman-KNN-Classifier-Analysis

### Description:
This code conducts a supervised classification analysis using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Haberman dataset. The dataset contains information about the survival rates of patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer. The code performs various tasks, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and parameter tuning.

### Techniques Used:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, column renaming, and data normalization
- Model Evaluation: Confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports
- Parameter Tuning: Testing different values of K and test sizes

## 2. Decision-Tree-Classifier-Analysis

### Description:
This code implements a Decision Tree classifier on the same Haberman dataset. It follows a similar workflow to the previous code but uses the Decision Tree algorithm instead of KNN. The code preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.

### Techniques Used:
- Decision Tree Classification
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, column renaming, and data normalization
- Model Evaluation: Confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports
- Parameter Tuning: Testing different random states for improved accuracy

## 3. Seed-Characteristics-Analysis-With-Pairplot

### Description:
This code analyzes a dataset containing seed characteristics, such as area, perimeter, compactness, etc. It loads the dataset, sets column names, and performs descriptive statistics. The main focus of this code is on visualizing the relationships between variables using pairplots.

### Techniques Used:
- Data Visualization: Pairplot for visualizing relationships between variables

## Conclusion:

Each code implementation offers valuable insights into different aspects of data analysis and machine learning. The techniques employed vary from classification algorithms like KNN and Decision Trees to data visualization methods like pairplots. These codes serve as practical examples of how to approach data analysis tasks using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
